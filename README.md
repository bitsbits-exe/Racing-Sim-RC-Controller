# Racing-Sim-RC-Controller

********** THIS IS THE OLD REPO - CHECK OUT THE NEW ONE HERE: https://github.com/bitsbits-exe/Sim-RC-Controller ****************

Early alpha release of scripts and sketches.  Probably lots of hurdles on your end to get them working, likely full of bugs, and lacking core functionality.  I'll do more work to the repo and make how-to's when I have some time.  Feel free to modify and improve the code as needed.  Reach out if intending to use commercially.

If you've got multiple input devices (ie. Mismatched wheelbase/pedals, or a HOTAS) the best way to get the scripts to work is by creating a vJoy device and using Joystick Gremlin to set all the bindings to the virtual joystick. When it asks you which device you want to use, be sure to select the vJoy device instead of selecting multiple inputs. It's a bit of a pain to set up in the beginning, but it might save some headaches in the future.
